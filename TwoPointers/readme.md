This Repository contains implementations of the Two Pointers Algorithm, a technique used in solving Arrays and Strings.
The pointers technique is used to solve programs that involve searching,sorting or partitioning arrays by maintaining two pointers.
It helps reduce the time complexity from O(NÂ²) to O(N) or O(N log N) in many cases.
